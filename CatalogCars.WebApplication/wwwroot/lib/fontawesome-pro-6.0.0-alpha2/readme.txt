### Font Awesome 6

Inside the `fontawesome6` folder are a ton of icons, styles, and goodness - it's the heart of gold for the Font Awesome 6 alpha. If you're working on an app or web project, you'll need to host these assets and files yourself, or for `npm` and `yarn` users, you can use our packages. If you're working on a desktop design or print project, you'll add the fonts to your system fonts or the SVG images directly to your files. All the details on how to use are in the documentation.

You'll see folders for both the `free` and a `pro` assets - Choose the one that's right for your project (free for open source projects, Pro for the widest variety of icons and styles). Here's what's hidden inside:

## A Word to the Wise

Remember, this is the freshest, hottest, and alpha-est Font Awesome you can get and we will likely shift things around before we cool it into the official release of Font Awesome 6. Don't burn your fingers - or your production sites - by relying on what's here!

## We Want Your Feedback!
Let us know how the alpha is shaping up for you - we want to hear anything on your mind, whether it's about how the alpha is packaged, if the included documentation is clear, or if the icons aren't spot-on awesome yet.
